      <description>Table of Contents  Abstract Demo Features Installation Development Credit &amp;amp; License Community Contributing Acknowledgements Further Documentation  Abstract  Password management should be simple and follow Unix philosophy.

      <description>FAQ error: gpg failed to sign the data On macOS upgrading gnupg can lead to Git commit signing breaking.
Be sure to have pinentry-mac installed, set gpg.program to gpg2 and add the no-tty option to your gpg.conf.
brew install pinentry-mac git config --global gpg.program $(which gpg2) echo &amp;quot;no-tty&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;~/.gnupg/gpg.conf  What&amp;rsquo;s up with the cute gopher? Our gopher was made by Vincent Leinweber while the original gopher is created by Renee French.</description>
